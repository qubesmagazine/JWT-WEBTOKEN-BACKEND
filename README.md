#Project Setup

Node.js, MongoDB, and Postman used to create a backend that implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. With JWT, users can be authenticated and authorized to access resources on the server. Here's how i created JWT backend:

First, create a MongoDB database to store user information, including usernames and hashed passwords.

Implement a login endpoint in your Node.js backend to receive the username and password in the POST request. Use the bcrypt library to compare the hashed password from the request with the hashed password stored in the database.

If the username and password are valid, create a new JWT using the jsonwebtoken library and send it back to the frontend in the response.

On the frontend, store the JWT in local storage or a cookie to send with each request to the backend.

Implement an authentication middleware in your Node.js backend to check the JWT in the header of the request. If the JWT is valid, allow access to the requested resource. Otherwise, return an error response.

Implement authorization checks in your Node.js backend to ensure that users have the correct permissions to access specific resources.

By using Node.js, MongoDB, and Postman, you can create a secure and reliable backend that implements JWT authentication and authorization. This will ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access the dashboard or other resources on the server.
